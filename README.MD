# Introduction 

We were asked to create a Flask application in which a user can enter the desired text in a field on the left and display the translation in another field on the right. The user can choose the desired input language as well as the desired output language. If the user does not know the language of the text they want to translate, there should be a feature that automatically detects the language. To do this, we will use the Google Translate API with Python, and finally, we will make it more visually appealing with a graphical interface with the use of HTML and CSS or JavaScript if we want .


# Tools

- Flask : Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, providing the essential tools and features to create web applications. Flask is known for its modularity, allowing developers to choose the components they need, and it supports extensions to add functionality as needed. Flask is ideal for small to medium-sized applications and is widely used for building APIs, microservices, and simple web applications. Its minimalistic approach makes it a popular choice for developers who want more control and customization in their projects.

- HTLM : HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic framework of a webpage, allowing developers to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

- CSS : CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to apply styles, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, to make webpages visually appealing and user-friendly. CSS works alongside HTML to enhance the presentation of web content.

- Google Translate API : An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are used to enable the integration of different systems and services, allowing them to interact and share functionality seamlessly. They are essential for building modern web applications, mobile apps, and software integrations, facilitating data exchange and functionality between different platforms and services.
